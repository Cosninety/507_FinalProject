## Routes in this application

- /index →   will contain instructions for accessing the other routes

- Route 1: /<artist>/img →   This page will show an image of an artists’ work.

- Route 2: /<artist>/blurb    →   This page will show a blurb about the artist retrieved from wikipedia. Alternatively, I may output wikipedia info into a csv and source from there.

- Route 3: /<artist>/add  → This page will add an artist’s name to a list. The route is intended to be a way for people to keep track of which artist’s work they’ve seen.
